# growth-equation
A growth equation using Edward Wilkinson model
Surface growth is often associated with the accretion of a physical surface, such as growing crystals and metals.
Generally, surface growth can be considered to be the time evolution of an interface - the interface representing the growing surface. It has been observed that these interfaces share some common properties in a wide range of applications, for example the time evolution of the interface roughness and the self-affine structure of the interface.
